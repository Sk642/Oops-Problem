Write a python code to check if an input string only consists of characters present in another given input string.
Code will take as input two strings and check if the first input string consists of only characters present in the 
second input string

if yes, program will print the message "input string is valid" without the quotes followed by the first input 
string in a separate line.

Otherwise, program will print the message "Input string is not valid without the quotes followed by the 
first input string in a separate line.

Example:
If input strings are "how" and "who are you", 
output will be:
Input string is valid
how

Note: All searches/string comparisons should be case insensitive.
Instructions to write main section of the code:

a. You would require to write the main section completely, hence please follow the below instructions for the same
b. You would require to write the main program which is inline to the "sample input description section" mentioned below and to read the data in the same sequence.

Input Description

1 Read two input strings one by one
2. If all the characters in the first input string is present in the second input string, print the message "Input string is valid" without the quotes followed by the first input string in a separate line
first input string a separate line
Otherwise print the message "Input string is not valid without the quotes followed by the

Sample Input 1:
how
how are you
Output:
Input string is valid
how

Sample Input 2:
