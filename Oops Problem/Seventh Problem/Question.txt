Create a class Project with the below attributes: 
projectid of type Number 
projectName of type String 
manHours of type Number 
technologyList of type List 
avgProjCost of type Number

Attribute description:
projectid represents the Project Id, projName represents the name of the project manHours represents 
the total man hours of the project for completion technologyList represents the a list of technologies(strings)
used in the project and avgProjCost represents the average project cost of the project.

Create the_init_method which takes all parameters except the average project cost in the above sequence. 
The method should set the value of attributes with parameter values, received.
Initialize the variable avgProjCost to 0 in this constructor

Create a method inside the class with the name calculateProjCost This method takes a numeric value as argument, 
which is the rate per man hour. This function calculate the project cost(refer formula below) based on man Hours 
and rate per man hour Return the calculated value

Formula for project calculation:

project cost= (total number of man Hours of the project)* (rate per man hour)

Ex if the man hours of the project is 100 and the given rate per man hour is Rs 200, then the project 
cost should be Rs 20000 and return the same

Create another class Organization with the below attributes

orgName of type String 
ProjList of type List having Project objects

Create the_init_method which takes all parameters in the above sequence. The method should set the value of attributes 
with parameter values inside the constructor

Create a method inside the class with the name projAvgCostByTechnology
The method takes two parameters First parameter is the Project id and the second parameter is the rate per man hour. 
The method should find the respective project, whose Project id is given as in the argument and calculate the average 
project cost price(refer the formula below for average cost price calculation) of the project and initialize this 
calculated value to the average project Cost(avgProjCost) attribute of the respective project object. Finally return the 
Project object 
Average project cost price = (project cost price returned by calculateProjCost function of the Project)/(total number of 
technologies in the project)

Note:
Use the method calculateProject defined in the project class to calculate the cost of the project.

If the project with given Project id is not found, then the method returns None. 
For more clarity on the above boundary validations, please refer the default main function.

You can use/refer the below given sample input and output to verify your solution using Custom Input option in 
Hackerrank.

Sample Input description:

1. The 1st input taken in the main section is the number of Project objects to be added to the list of Projects 
2. The next three lines of inputs are the project id, project name total man hours of the corresponding project 
3.The next line of input represents the number of technologies in the project(Mentioned in the second line of input)

The next line is the technology name and these input lines are repeated as per the technologies count mentioned in the
 previous line (number of technologies in the respective project)
4 .The above steps (2 and 3) repeated for number of objects given in the first line of input(Point #1)
